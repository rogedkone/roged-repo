# Zelda Moon Head Man
Adds the Majora's Mask Moon as a Head Man Clone
- Eyes now look at you, with spotlights that follow it's gaze with different colors for idle and chase.
- Has an expression when chasing.
- Has a few custom audio replacements from Majora's Mask.
- Forgot to set the Chase mode Textures/Materials, so the eyes become purple, but kind of adds to it, so might modify it for a feature.
