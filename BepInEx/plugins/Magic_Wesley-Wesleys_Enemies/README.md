| The Gusher is a hazardous creature, he likes to wander <br> around and rest in sneaky places.<br>He is completely blind.. <br> But a good listener in compensation. <br> Very sensitive personality however.| Very much like the Gusher. <br> However, the Roaster likes to keep the conversations short. <br> He's the upgrade. <br> Not common in earlier levels. <br> Probably a good thing...|

| The Droid                                      | The Destroyer                                   |

| This poor droid was left to fend on his own. <br> We are not sure what he's up to now but.. <br> I am sure he'll be pleased to see some fellow droids. | His look matches his behaviour. <br> Do not try to interact with this creature. <br> Avoid.|
