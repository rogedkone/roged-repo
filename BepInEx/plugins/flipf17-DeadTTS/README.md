# DeadTTS

Allows you to hear TTS from dead players.<br>
TTS audio from dead players are directional, but can be configured to play in your head.<br>
TTS text will appear near dead players' heads.<br>
Each player will have a random TTS pitch while dead. This way, dead players can have a unique pitch each round! The random pitches will change between levels.

This mod *shouldn't* allow dead players to alert monsters.<br>

#### Please report any issues on the mod's github page, or find the related channel in the modding discord. Thank you!
