# Walkie Talkie

This mod introduces walkie talkies to REPO. 

### How it works
Hold 'F' key to use. There is a stamina for the walkie talkie so use it carefully. Multiple people can talk in their walkie talkie at the same time.

### Changelog
- 1.1.1: Made UI more responsive to not interfere with @dig's Minimap, etc.
- 1.1.0: Added config settings and enemies now hear the walkie talkies.
- 1.0.4: Fixed avatar heads issues
