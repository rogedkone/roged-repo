# Dark R.E.P.O.
Makes the game darker and brightens the flashlight.
Values are configurable via the Mod Manager, or in-game if REPOConfig v1.1.2 or above is installed.

## Settings

**General Settings**
* AmbientFactor: how bright things when there are no lights
* LightFactor: how bright the things that light up their surroundings are.
* LightFactor: how bright textures that "glow" are. (but only those objects, it doesn't light up surroundings)
* FlashlightFactor: how bright the flashlight is.

If you set all general settings to 1.0, everything will be the same as the base game.

**Level Settings**
There are settings for all menu scenes and levels.
* Value below 0: the level will be darker than the general settings.
* Value equal to 0: the level will use the general settings.
* Value above 0: the level will be brighter than the general settings.
* Value equal to 1: the level will use the base game settings.

## Complementary Mods
If the shaky flashlight animation causes motion sickness,
try turning off camera animations in settings, and using the [StableFlashlight](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/linkoid/StableFlashlight/) mod.

Users have suggested that [KeepMyFlashlight](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/nickklmao/KeepMyFlashlight/)
complements this mod well if the complete darkess when crouching too scary.
