## ShadyMod.Repo 

With this mod you are able to steal others' lives when you are low (<= 9 HP, configuarable)

- Idea by Lasse.
- Tests by belebt.

You can configure it by manually editing the config file after the first start, or, as I recommend, by using this mod: [RepoConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/nickklmao/REPOConfig/). 
IMPORTANT: Only the host settings are considered!
