# R.E.P.O. Discord Rich Presence
Simple REPO mod that adds integration for Discord Rich Presence, allowing profile stalkers to see exactly how you're doing in-game. Presence will update as soon as possible whenever your game state switches (eg. changing levels, filling the extraction point, or buying something at the shop). Feel free to add me on Discord for anything - `@swaggies`.

## Details
This mod has rich presence data for:
- The main menu
- The tutorial
- Multiplayer lobby screen
    - Including the number of players currently in the lobby
- The Disposal Arena
- The Service Station
    - Including how much money you currently have
    - *(see above preview image)*
- The truck lobby (between levels)
- The current level stats, including:
    - Number of extractions completed and total
    - The haul goal (quota) and progress
    - Whether you are currently extracting
    - Whether all extractions are completed
    - The current map you're on
    - *(see above preview image)*

Large image icons were quickly thrown together by me, using images taken from the game's assets. Unsupported maps (such as new ones not yet included or modded maps) will not have an icon and will instead display the normal REPO game icon (rich presence details will be unaffected by this).
