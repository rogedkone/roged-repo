# Information

The plugin has been moved here to address the Xunity issue. Due to numerous DLL using it during loading, they encountered problems with "Package rejected - Invalid submission." First and foremost, all of this was done to assist [RTLC Russian Translation](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Hayrizan/RTLC_Russian_Translation/).

If you are also encountering errors when updating localization, you can use this mod as a dependency and remove Xunity from your archive directly.
