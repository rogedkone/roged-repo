**Changes the TTS to support multiple languages.**

## Features

This mods replaces the ingame text to speech with eSpeak which supports multiple languages and some customization.

>This is my first mod, it is pretty much in alpha and has not been thoroughly tested. Bugs might occur which breaks the TTS. Compatibility with other mods affecting TTS is unknown.

## Upcoming features

- Independent voice settings (language, pitch, ...) per player.
- Possibility to speak in other languages (by adding "\[lang\]" before the text).

## Usage

In the mod config file (generated after you launch the game once) you will have the following options:
1. ``Language``: Set to any language supported by [espeak-ng](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/59823f30e3edbd01e87002c04a49ebfd63edaaa7/docs/languages.md)
2. ``Variant``: Set to a voice variant (male, female or croak. See config file for more info)
3. ``Pitch``: Set to change the default pitch (before the game applies effects to the voice)
4. ``Speed``: Set to change the speed of the voice.
