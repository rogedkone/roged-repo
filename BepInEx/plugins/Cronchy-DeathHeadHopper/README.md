## Features:
✅ Hop around as your head after dying.\
✅ Switch to spectate others anytime.\
✅ Includes tweaks to keep the gameplay balanced and fair.

*Small teaser for what's coming up next...*

## Controls
While spectating, you can switch to your own head and control its movement.

**Jump (Space)** – Bounce into the air\
**Movement keys (WASD)** – Control jump direction\
**Tumble (Q)** – Reorient your head

## Notes

### Mod Requirements
The host must have this mod installed, and any players who want to use it must install it as well.\
For the full experience, all players should have the mod installed.

---

### Balance Tweaks
* Reviving in truck always requires player interaction (grabbing the head)
* **Anchor tethering mechanic**: player heads get anchored to the ground and to item carts, restricting their movement to a smaller area. Grabbing their head will break them free. (can be enabled and or further restricted in the config)

---

### Configuration
**FlashlightFlicker** – The head flickers its flashlight to indicate when something is wrong.

#### ⚙️ Host-Determined Rules  

**AnchorMode** – Always anchor head with a tether | anchor once the last extraction point is completed | never anchor.
