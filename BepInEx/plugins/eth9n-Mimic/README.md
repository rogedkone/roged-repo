# Mimic 

Mimic is a Skinwalker (Lethal Company Mod) inspired mod for R.E.P.O that allows the creatures of the game to sound like you or your friends!

### How it works:
This mod will record you and your friend's voices between an interval (30 - 120 seconds by default) and save the audio into a pool of clips. After a clip has been saved, a random clip from the pool will be played by each enemy on the current level.

### Planned Additions:

- Caching audio in memory (no more writing files)
- Optimizations!

### Changelog
- 1.1.6 : Configuration file support with modded enemies, toggle for hearing your own voice, sampling rate option (experimental).
- 1.1.5 : Volume slider, config adjustments, better audio.
- 1.1.4 : Audio adjustments (No more popping when voice clips are played!)
